### 📦 Installation Steps:

1. **Disable Windows Real-Time Protection**

### ⚙️ Known Limitations

Enqro currently offers **approximately 89% UNC (Universal Name Convention) sync compatibility**. While it may not support every script, it runs most popular ones — including **HohoHub** and many others — smoothly.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting
